# Minecraft Version Extended
This repo contains a set of official Minecraft Versions which are not included on the official manifest. That means most Minecraft Launchers can not find them and run them.
## Versions Index
## Where?

## How to use?
1. Make a directory in your `.minecraft/versions`, like `.minecraft/versions/combat`
2. Copy one of the `.json` files into the directory, name it with the same name of your version, like `combat.json`
3. Download the files of the version using your launcher using `Repair Files`(补全文件 in Chinese).
4. Enjoy it.
We also provide a `version_manifest.json` with the versions included. see [version_manifest.json](version_manifest.json)
   
## Comments
[^1]: Unfortunately, this file is hard to be found. So that I' ve downloaded it on [indiedb.com](https://www.indiedb.com/games/minecraft/downloads/minecraft-survival-test-030-2018-edition). Although I' ve checked, you still need to be careful using it.
[^2]: Although MOJANG uploaded the builds of many Minecraft ancient versions. They didn' t upload their `version.json`. You may need to use some nearby versions' `version.json` in order to launch these versions.
